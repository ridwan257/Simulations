# Making Simulation Using pygame
Simulation of evolutionary processes inspired by nature, particularly genetic algorithms. I have structured it well to facilitate easy implementation of Pygame, ensuring better organized code for simulating.
## to test any module
*export PYTHONPATH=<path_of_dir>/Simualtions:$PYTHONPATH* or,
*python3 -m classes/Rocket*
